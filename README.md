# django_tutorials
Django tutorials on all the basics of building web apps using Django. This course is just to cover the basics and to have something to reference at all times. 

- Also, if you are cloning/downloading this repository for the first time you will need to set it up. If you notice there is a `bin/` directory. Inside that directory is two scripts. One for a windows operating system and the other for ubuntu. So before running the appropriate shell script make sure you are in the `django_tutorials` root directory and then run: 

> ```sh . ./bin/setup_env.sh ``` OR ```sh . ./bin/setup_env_ubuntu.sh ```
